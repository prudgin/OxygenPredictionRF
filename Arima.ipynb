Measurements were taken twice daily, during the morning and evening, aligning closely with sunrise and sunset timings (with a variance of +/- one hour).\n\nTLDR: The model accurately captures the overarching trends, presenting an error (RMSE) ranging from 0.8 to 2. It performs well, especially when the data remains relatively stable. However, during episodes of heightened DO fluctuations, particularly those caused by liming or the introduction of manure (which exerts a substantial oxygen demand), the model struggles to adapt.\n\nScroll to the bottom to see predicted vs real data graphs.\n\nA SARIMA model will be used. SARIMA, or Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, is a forecasting method that analyzes time-based data by considering its past values (autoregressive), handling trends and irregularities (integrated), and factoring in past forecast errors (moving average). It extends its capabilities by accounting for repeating patterns over specific intervals, like seasons. By combining these components, SARIMA can provide accurate predictions for future data points, making it a valuable tool for understanding and forecasting various cyclic phenomena.",

A value of zero means the data is perfectly symmetrical, while positive/negative values indicate skewed distributions.\nKurtosis: Measures the \"tailedness\" of the distribution.

      "source": "### Stationarity\n\nIn time series analysis, stationarity is a fundamental concept. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, are all constant over time. In simpler terms, if you take any segment of the series, its characteristics would be similar to any other segment. This is essential because most time series forecasting methods, including SARIMA, assume or require the series to be stationary.\n\nA non-stationary series, on the other hand, shows patterns, trends, or seasonality. This means that over time, its mean, variance, or behavior might change.\n\nADF Test\n\nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a popular method to test the stationarity of a series. The core idea behind the test is to determine if there's a unit root in the series. If present, it suggests the series is non-stationary. The test returns several statistics, including:\n\nadf - The test statistic. A more negative value indicates stronger evidence against the hypothesis of a unit root.\np-value - This shows the probability of observing the test result if the series has a unit root. A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates that the series is likely stationary.\nCritical values - These provide thresholds at which we can decide whether or not to reject the hypothesis of a unit root.\nInterpretations\n\nnp1: The ADF test statistic (-3.4) is more negative than the 5% critical value (-2.9) and the p-value is 0.01, which is below the common alpha level of 0.05. This indicates strong evidence against the unit root hypothesis, suggesting that the series is stationary.\n\nnp2: Similar to np1, the test statistic (-3.0) suggests the series is stationary.\n\nvp1: With an ADF statistic of -2.1, which is less negative than the 5% critical value, and a p-value of 0.23, this series appears to have a unit root and is non-stationary.\n\nvp2 & vp3: Both ponds have ADF statistics much more negative than the 5% threshold, indicating stationarity.\n\nvp4: The ADF statistic (-2.7) is closer to the 5% threshold and the p-value is slightly above 0.05. This means there's weaker evidence against the unit root hypothesis, suggesting potential non-stationarity in the series.",

While some (vp2) managed decent results, others (np1, vp3) showed potential issues like autocorrelation.\n\nPonds with High Initial Normality but Non-stationary (vp1, vp4): Despite having non-stationary data, these ponds' models managed decent results.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a trend that ponds with initially more normal and stationary data tend to have models with better residuals, it's not strictly the case for all ponds.

After the prediction is made, the window moves one step forward in the time series, and the model is retrained to predict the next value. This process rolls on until predictions are generated for the entire series. Such an approach offers a dynamic way to assess how well the model might perform in a real-world scenario where it's constantly updated with new observations. The code also considers Box-Cox transformations, ensuring predictions are on the original data scale, and measures forecast accuracy using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).",

Model performance, based on RMSE, suggests potential room for improvement.\n#### np2\nInitial State: High normality and stationary.\n\nLjung-Box Test: Residuals are white noise.\n\nRolling Window RMSE: 1.512, R2: 0.12\n\nAssessment: The model for np2, which had relatively normal initial data, showed a relatively good performance based on its RMSE. However, R2 implies that the model explains only 12% of the data.\n#### vp1\nInitial State: High normality but non-stationary.\n\nLjung-Box Test: Residuals are white noise.\n\nRolling Window RMSE: 2.091, R2: 0.56\nThe warning message suggests that the optimization procedure for MLE did not converge. The model couldn't find a set of parameters that best fit the data within the specified number of iterations. The parameter estimates for your model might not be reliable.\n\nAssessment: The model's RMSE for vp1 is higher compared to np1 and np2, indicating potential model inefficiencies despite the residuals appearing as white noise and R2 is as high as 0.56.\n#### vp2\nInitial State: Moderate normality and stationary.\n\nLjung-Box Test: Residuals might be white noise.\n\nRolling Window RMSE: 1.972, R2: 0.40\n\nAssessment: vp2's model exhibited acceptible performance, indicated by its RMSE, despite its initial data showing some deviations from normality.\n#### vp3\nInitial State: Low normality but stationary.\n\nLjung-Box Test: Some potential autocorrelation.\n\nRolling Window RMSE: 0.779, R2: 0.75\n\nAssessment: Despite having less normal initial data, vp3's model showed good performance based on its low RMSE and high R2, although the residuals indicate potential autocorrelation.\n#### vp4\nInitial State: Low normality and non-stationary.\n\nLjung-Box Test: Residuals might be white noise.\n\nRolling Window RMSE: 0.992, R2: 0.74\n\nAssessment: vp4's model, with a decent RMSE and R2 score, demonstrates the model's ability to capture the dynamics of the time series data, even with less normal and non-stationary initial conditions.\n\n#### Overall Insights:\nThere's a discernible relationship between the initial conditions of the data (normality and stationarity) and the model's performance as assessed by RMSE. Generally, ponds with initially more normal and stationary data tend to have models with better residuals, but the rolling window technique does introduce some nuances to this observation. Specifically, some ponds, despite having less than ideal initial conditions, manage to produce models with decent RMSE values. On the flip side, certain ponds with good initial conditions might have higher RMSE values, suggesting potential model inefficiencies or challenges in predicting more complex patterns in the data.",
